How to play:

##### Goals

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
* Game must refresh using the provided 'dt' time delta variable provided in the engine.js file
* Implement a 'Lives' system, similar to the Memory Game project - Player has 5 lives which reduce with a collision
